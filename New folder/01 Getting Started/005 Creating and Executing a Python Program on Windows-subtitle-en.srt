H, again. In this video I'll show you how to create and how to run a Python program. In the previous lecture

1
00:08.060 --> 00:13.070
we set up Python and we ran a Python interactive session.

2
00:13.260 --> 00:15.960
So that was like a running code line by line.

3
00:16.170 --> 00:22.020
But what you want to do instead, we want to write code that we are able to save it in a file and we're

4
00:22.020 --> 00:25.150
able to run all the code at once.

5
00:25.200 --> 00:27.220
So that's what we're going to do in this lecture.

6
00:27.460 --> 00:30.720
And this is targeted to Windows users.

7
00:30.720 --> 00:32.940
So if you have a Windows computer please watch this.

8
00:32.970 --> 00:38.550
If you have a Mac computer or even a Linux computer please skip this video and go to the next video

9
00:39.240 --> 00:44.070
where I show you the same process but on a Mac computer. So Windows users,

10
00:44.220 --> 00:52.230
let's create a Python program and we're going to use very basic tools for now.

11
00:52.250 --> 00:59.760
But then in the next lecture we're going to download and use an advanced editor. On Windows before creating

12
00:59.760 --> 01:00.850
the program

13
01:00.890 --> 01:06.840
there is something you need to make sure of. You go to organize and you go to folder search options

14
01:07.590 --> 01:12.990
you go to View and then look here for this option.

15
01:12.990 --> 01:15.510
Hide extensions for known file types.

16
01:15.600 --> 01:23.380
You want to make sure this option is unchecked just as I have it here. Don't check it.

17
01:24.230 --> 01:34.170
Cancel that and with the option unchecked you go had and right click and create create a text document.

18
01:34.710 --> 01:36.180
And put a name.

19
01:36.180 --> 01:41.670
Let's say my program and you want to remove the txt extension.

20
01:42.120 --> 01:43.660
And want to say .py.

21
01:47.800 --> 01:48.290
OK.

22
01:48.320 --> 01:49.160
No problem.

23
01:49.190 --> 01:51.100
I want to change the name.

24
01:51.470 --> 01:54.970
Now this is a file where you're going to write your Python code.

25
01:55.070 --> 01:59.750
So just go ahead and edit, edit it with an editor that you have.

26
01:59.760 --> 02:02.760
Maybe Notepad.

27
02:02.900 --> 02:05.030
We're going to use Atom later. For now

28
02:05.030 --> 02:05.790
this is good.

29
02:06.070 --> 02:12.080
And this program, what this will do, it will print out some text.

30
02:12.320 --> 02:14.690
Let's say the 'Hello' text.

31
02:14.750 --> 02:20.300
So that's what you do, you use the Python print function, and the print function

32
02:20.300 --> 02:21.760
has this syntax.

33
02:22.070 --> 02:26.320
So it expects to have some brackets opening and closing brackets.

34
02:26.590 --> 02:31.690
And inside these brackets you want to pass the thing that you want to print out.

35
02:31.700 --> 02:36.020
In this case this is called a string. We'll cover strings later.

36
02:36.140 --> 02:38.520
Or you can say text.

37
02:38.660 --> 02:42.690
So we want to print out some text and text goes inside quotes always.

38
02:42.940 --> 02:53.930
So strings go, strings go inside quotes. Make sure you want to save control s, exit the script and then click

39
02:54.030 --> 03:01.610
outside in here and hold shift and then right click and then you want to go to

40
03:07.910 --> 03:12.330
Open command window here that you open the command prompt.

41
03:12.440 --> 03:16.560
Look carefully and you'll see that the command prompt was open.

42
03:16.560 --> 03:25.370
In this current directory which reflects which is actually the directory of your python file.

43
03:25.430 --> 03:28.960
So this one in here. This one in here is in here.

44
03:29.360 --> 03:36.050
So before you run the program you need to have these two directories the same because if you open

45
03:36.050 --> 03:44.250
the command prompt from here as we did in the previous lecture that will go to another default directory.

46
03:45.240 --> 03:48.870
So the best way to do it as I did it here.

47
03:48.990 --> 03:56.520
Click and go to open command window here and then what you do is you type python and then the name of your

48
03:56.520 --> 04:07.080
program, my program.py. So what you're doing is you're using Python, the python program to execute

49
04:07.200 --> 04:14.690
this file and you get the output in the command line which is hello, the text Hello.

50
04:15.960 --> 04:25.780
Similarly I could execute it with my Python 3.6, dot py and you get the same output again.

51
04:25.890 --> 04:29.180
So 3.6, 3.7 doesn't make any big difference.

52
04:29.190 --> 04:31.560
The differences are very very slight.

53
04:31.590 --> 04:33.670
So you don't have to worry about that.

54
04:33.690 --> 04:36.320
Let me execute it one more time, Python.

55
04:36.540 --> 04:44.480
If you type now my and if you press the Tab key, that will autocomplete the name of your file.

56
04:44.480 --> 04:50.130
So it will find the name of your file because it knows that you are in the current directory so use Tab

57
04:50.130 --> 04:54.670
for auto completion and yeah, again you execute it and you get the output.

58
04:54.930 --> 05:02.130
Of course you can go ahead and add other lines of code there. Let's say print 7, a number.

59
05:02.130 --> 05:10.710
Numbers don't go inside quotes, control s to save and close and go to the command line again and press

60
05:10.890 --> 05:15.780
the upper arrow key to execute, to call a previously executed statement.

61
05:15.840 --> 05:19.580
So upper arrow key will call Python my program.py. Execute and you get

62
05:19.590 --> 05:19.990
Hello

63
05:20.020 --> 05:22.120
and 7.  That's the idea.

64
05:22.140 --> 05:24.890
Hope you enjoyed this and I'll talk to you in the next lecture.
