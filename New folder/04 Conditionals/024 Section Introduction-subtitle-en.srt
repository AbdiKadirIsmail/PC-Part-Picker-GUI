Hi and welcome to this new section! In
this section you're going to learn about

3
00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:10,250
two very important concepts in
programming. These are functions and

5
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:17,390
conditionals. Functions, functions are
used to keep your code more organized so

7
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:24,029
think of functions as small chunks of
code which together build a program that

9
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:27,240
is what you need to know for now.
Functions are useful for other things as

11
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:31,800
well but you'll understand it as you
build the real world programs. In the next

13
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:36,960
video I'll write a function but that is
just a standalone function, so it

15
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,579
doesn't interact with other parts of the
code, it's just a function, but when you

17
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:45,390
see the large applications later on
you'll see how the function integrates

19
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:51,149
with other parts of the code, so that's a
good thing of creating reload programs.

21
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:56,579
That is how you'll learn how to do
programming in real life. That's about

23
00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:00,600
functions and then in this section you'll
also learn conditionals which basically

25
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:06,869
are used to have your program make
decisions, so if that number is greater

27
00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:12,150
than that do this, if it's not greater
than do this other thing, that's

29
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:17,340
basically the idea, but you'll see it in
action, so this is about the introduction

31
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:21,680
of this section. I'll see you in the
other lecture.
