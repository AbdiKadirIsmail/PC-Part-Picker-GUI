Hey, hello again. In this lecture you're going to learn
about conditionals. What is a conditional? 

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:14,190
Well a conditional is a block of code which
performs different actions depending on

5
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:19,980
whether a given conditional evaluates to
true or false so let's go ahead and

7
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:29,340
create a conditional in Python. I'll create the
file conditionals dot py and let me

9
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:35,280
create a conditional block, and first of
all let me create a variable. Let's say a

11
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,920
equals five and here I'll create a
conditional block. This block, what this

13
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:48,780
will do is it will perform an action if
a is less than five and another action

15
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:54,930
if a is equal or greater than five
so let me create that. If this, our

17
00:00:54,930 --> 00:01:04,049
conditional starts if a and let's say
less than five print, let's say less than 5.

19
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:15,030
Press ENTER and if you want to perform
more actions with this conditional, with

21
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:19,979
this condition so when this condition is
true this will be executed but if you

23
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:25,049
want to perform more actions you can add
one there, if not then you can go to the

25
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:32,159
next check.
So that would be else, so you have a

27
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:45,060
column here, a column there, so else print
equal or greater than 5. Now let me

29
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:53,520
execute it. And we get equal or greater
than 5. So why did you get that? Well

31
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:59,729
because you know if a is less than 5
which is not, so this evaluates to false,

33
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:05,340
that means with this this will not be
executed so Python will skip this line

35
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:12,870
and it will go to the next one. This next
line says else, so else means if this

37
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:18,450
is not true,
this will be executed, so equal or

39
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:25,769
greater than five, so in this case if a
is not less than five then there's no

41
00:02:25,769 --> 00:02:32,549
other option but a is either equal or
greater than five, so that's an if and else

43
00:02:32,549 --> 00:02:36,959
conditional block. However if you want to
add more conditions there

45
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:45,569
you want to use elif, so let's do that
the first two lines stay the same. If a

47
00:02:45,569 --> 00:02:57,840
is less than five print less than five
elif a is equal to five print equal to

49
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:19,019
five else print greater than five. Save
and execute and you get equal to five.

51
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:21,769
If a was six,
you'd get greater than five and if a was

53
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:34,500
three you'd get less than five.
That's a conditional block in Python and

55
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:39,480
yeah, try to get familiar with the syntax
and in the next lecture I'm going to

57
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:47,569
incorporate a conditional with this
block of code, so see you there.
