1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,000
All right, you learnt how to use a for
loop to iterate through a list.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,170
Sometimes though you might want to, you might have
to iterate through two lists at the same time,

5
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:16,619
so let's say you have two lists.
A list with three items so here you have

7
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:23,640
some names say James, John, and Jack.
Pretty creative here and you also have

9
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:35,030
another list let's say email domains
which also has three items as Gmail

11
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:42,360
Hotmail and Yahoo. If you'd like to apply
the same operation to the items of both

13
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:48,090
lists you'd use the for loop
in a slightly different way, so everything

15
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:53,010
starts with the for keyword and here
you'd have to pass two variables.

17
00:00:53,010 --> 00:01:00,510
Let's say the variable I and the variable J.
So for I comma J in and you'd use the zip

19
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:06,170
function here and there is where you put
the names of your list.

21
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:12,030
Email domains. That's it. Here is where you
write your actions, your operations what

23
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:18,270
you want to do with the variable I and J.
Let's try to print them out first before

25
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:25,500
we do something more creative, so this is
how you print two variables at the same time.

27
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:31,979
Click Save.
Go to your online, place Script7.

29
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:35,970
And so you get both the items of the
first list and the items of the second list.

31
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:41,939
So that's how you use the for loop
for iterating in more than one list.

33
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:44,570
So let's move on.
