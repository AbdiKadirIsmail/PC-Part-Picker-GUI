            <p><strong>Frequently Asked Questions(FAQ)about the setting up Python</strong></p>

<p>If you have a question about the installation process please find your question below and if you don't find it, please feel free to ask in the Q&amp;A area.</p>

<p><strong>1. Iinstalled Python butcannot execute it.</strong></p>

<p>If the installation process went smooth, but when you call python you get an error that might mean Python has not been added to your computer path, therefore your computer is not being able to find the <code>python </code>command. If you are on Windows, lease follow <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/4855685" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">these instructions</a>. Mac users please follow <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/3387737" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">these</a>.</p>

<p><strong>2.Ihave Python 2already. Should Iinstall Python 3 instead?</strong></p>







<p>The course covers Python 3, and it's recommended that you install and usePython 3 as Python 2will not be supported anymore by 2020. Simply install Python 3 and then you can use it as:</p>







<p><code>python3 myprogram.py</code></p>





<p>Mac and Linux users, if your computer has Python 2by default, don't uninstall it as it may harm your operating system. Simply install Python 3 and leave Python 2as it is and use Python 3 as shown above.</p>





<p><strong>3.Ihave installed Python through theAnaconda package. Should Iuninstall and install again?</strong></p>





<p>No, just use what you have. Anaconda is just a package that installs Python and some extra Python libraries.</p><p>4. pip is not working. What should Ido?</p><p>Try:</p><p>python -m pip install package_name</p>





<p><strong>5.I can install packages with pip, but I cannot import them in Python.</strong></p>





<p>That could mean you have two Python installations in your computer. For example, you are installing packages for your Python 2and trying to import them in your Python 3. To install packages for Python 3 you will have to do:</p>





<p><code>pip3 install package_name</code><br></p>



<p>Then you should be able to import it in Python 3. Note that if have only Python 3, you would write pip instead of pip3.</p>
