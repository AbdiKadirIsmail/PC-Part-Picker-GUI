00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,490
Good, now you know the definition of a
loop and you know that we have for

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:10,050
loops and while loops in Python and in
this lecture you'll learn how to write

5
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:15,509
for loops. Now a for loop normally
iterates through a list of objects and

7
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:21,000
applies some methods or some functions
or some operations over each of these

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,039
objects. The array that the for loop
iterates through is not necessarily a

11
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:30,390
list. It can be a tuple. Sometimes it
can be a dictionary. It can even be a

13
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:36,329
string so every object that is made of
other simpler objects, so let's create a list.

15
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:44,370
First let's say emails is a list of
three emails, three mail addresses, so

17
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:53,719
let's write some fake email addresses.
Me at gmail.com you hotmail.com and

19
00:00:53,719 --> 00:01:01,350
they at gmail.com. Now let's say you want
to print out, you want to apply the print

21
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:06,390
function to each item of this list and
the stupid way to do this would be to

23
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:12,960
print out every item one by one. Let's
say the first item which has an index of

25
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:19,619
zero and then you do the same for emails
with index of one and so on.

27
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:26,430
That's definitely not how we want to
do it, so to print out these three items

29
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:31,500
we use a for loop and for loop always
start with the for keyword and then you

31
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:36,180
pick a variable let's say email so don't
confuse the email variable with the

33
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:43,619
emails variable, these are totally different.
And for email in emails, so here you pass

35
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:49,200
the variable that calls the list you want
to iterate through and press ENTER and

37
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,299
as you see here we got the indentation
so the line that follows the first line

39
00:01:54,299 --> 00:02:00,450
of the loop is always invented. So that
means this line here that will write

41
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:06,930
belongs to this loop, so it's part of
this block and here is where we write

43
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:10,830
the action, the statement we want to
execute multiple times, so we want

45
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:15,740
to print
the email so that is very

47
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:20,420
straightforward and very clean and very
readable. Now let's execute this before

49
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:27,290
I explain it to you better. Save the
script first and execute. Now this is

51
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:34,490
script 4, so we got the three items
printed out on the screen and I

53
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:40,250
obviously got an ad wrong here, no
problem. So what the code does is that

55
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:47,150
you say for each item in the list emails
print aout the item and of course you can

57
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:52,340
use every variable that you like if this
is more readable for you so for each

59
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:58,610
item in email please print out the item.
Great, let's do something more fancy here.

61
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:05,270
I'll delete this line of code and now I
would like to print out only the emails

63
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:10,880
that have Gmail address associated with
them so I don't want to print out any

65
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:15,770
other item rather than the Gmail ones.
So that means we want Python to make a

67
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:21,590
decision. If it finds Gmail in the item
in the string, it will print it out, if it

69
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:27,290
doesn't find it will not print it out, so
we want to use conditional here and that

71
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:35,500
would be an if statement. So again we say
for each item in the list if the string

73
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:46,880
Gmail is in item print out the item so
I'm sure this was easier than you were

75
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:53,600
expecting.
Let's save ctrl s and execute. So we got

77
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:59,180
only the Gmail accounts print adult.
So again we are saying for item in emails,

79
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:05,720
and when we do this Python grabs the
first item of the list so the first

81
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:11,060
iteration is there is about the first
item and this item is temporarily stored

83
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:18,140
in the variable item then while this
value is stored in this variable, Python

85
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:23,390
checks if the string Gmail is in that
variable, so with the first item this is

87
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:29,120
true and that's why python prints
out the item, so it prints out

89
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:35,060
me@gmail.com then it goes to the next item.
If gmail is in that item, it prints

91
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:39,889
out the item. In this case gmail is not
there, so it doesn't do anything and it

93
00:04:39,889 --> 00:04:45,710
goes to the next item, so that's why we
call it loop, so the loop goes in and

95
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:51,710
out in and out until the list is
exhausted so when it goes to the third

97
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:56,560
item to the last item on the list the
loop ends and the output is generated

99
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:02,479
like here. And don't forget about
indentation so be careful and look here

101
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:07,880
that we indented under the for loop
and again we indented under the if

103
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:13,550
statement because this indentation here
is part of the if block and this one

105
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:19,880
here is part of the for loop block so
very readable code and I believe very

107
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:24,520
fun to write. I'll see you in the next
lecture.
