Hi, in this lecture you're going to learn
about variables. So what is a variable?

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:10,980
Well a variable is like a container
where you can store various data types

5
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:18,539
in Python for instance this program now
this doesn't have any variable in it for

7
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:23,699
now, so let me try and execute it and
you'll see that this prints out of the

9
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:29,609
hello string. String is a data type, but
we'll cover that later. Now what is the

11
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:38,790
variable? Well and variables will keep
your code more organized. Let me create a

13
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:45,149
variable here, greeting so you can call
your variables whatever you like you can

15
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:50,070
give them any name however there are
some naming rules which I'll mention in

17
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:55,739
just a bit, so let me create this
variable for now. I'll store in this

19
00:00:55,739 --> 00:01:01,980
variable, I said variables are like
containers so I'll store this text in the

21
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:07,799
variable greeting and then what I do is
instead of doing print hello I'll do

23
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:15,570
print greeting and save the script ctrl
s and then go through the command line,

25
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:22,229
the upper arrow key, enter to execute and
you get the same output. So this is how

27
00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:26,670
you create a variable you don't use any
quotes because when you use quotes you

29
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:34,229
are creating a string data type not a
variable and you can also use a dash

31
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:43,439
before the variable that would also be
fine so you get the output correctly

33
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:50,549
but you cannot use numbers before the
variable ctrl s to save, execute and get

35
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:56,820
an invalid syntax, so this syntax is not
valid in Python, but you can use numbers

37
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:09,119
after or between the variable name let's
say here greeting2. So that would

39
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:13,860
be fine to use so that's the condition
about naming

41
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:19,470
your variables, you can start them with a
letter or a, or an underscore. Now if

43
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:24,720
you're not experienced with programming
you may still be confused on why do we

45
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:31,370
use these variables? Well this is a very
simple program, actually very useless, but

47
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:37,140
normally your programs will interact
with your users. That is what we call a

49
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:43,140
real program. You create a program to
give it to people so they can interact

51
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:48,810
with the program they can generate all
different outputs and so on, so let's go

53
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:57,060
Ahead and make this program more dynamic, so
what I'll do here is I'll get the text

55
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:03,720
from the user interactively. To do that
you need to use the input function, this

57
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:09,959
is also a Python function and inside
the function you can enter a message to the

59
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:16,640
user so let's say write a greeting.
A column and make some space there and then

61
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:28,290
you print greeting2, save the script.
Execute and now the program is asking

63
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:36,060
us to enter some input so let's go ahead
and say hi this time and we get the output

65
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:42,150
Printed out in here, hi, so what
happened here is we created a variable

67
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:49,320
and that variable will store the value
that the user submits in the command line

69
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:55,590
here, in the terminal so the user
submitted the hi text and this text will be

71
00:03:55,590 --> 00:04:00,989
stored in this variable so as I said
variables are like containers and then can

73
00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:06,390
use this text in various ways, but in
this scenario I'm just passing it to the

75
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:12,030
print function, so I want to print it out
on the terminal here and the print

77
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:16,709
function will get the value that is
stored in the greeting2 variable and

79
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:22,650
print it out on the terminal. That's it.
And yeah, I'd like to close this lecture

81
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:27,110
now and I'll see you in the next lecture.
