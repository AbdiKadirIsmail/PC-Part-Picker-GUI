Hey welcome to this new section and
throughout the lectures of this section

3
00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:10,200
you are going to learn computer
vision with. Python I'll explain computer

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:16,230
vision in a minute. So that's what we're
going to learn in this section

7
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:19,859
and then in the next section we'll build
an application that detects moving objects

9
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:25,619
from the computer webcam and stores
and visualizes the times when the object

11
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:31,949
entered and exited the video frame.
So that's an application area of

13
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:37,410
computer vision. Now, maybe you have an
idea of what computer vision is, but if

15
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:44,280
not I'll explain it now. So computer
vision is the field that deals with

17
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:49,980
acquiring and processing images and it
makes decisions based on the, on the

19
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:56,760
images, so you pass an image to the
computer and the computer tries to understand

21
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:01,770
it and it can do certain things such as
it can tell you how many faces

23
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:08,790
there are in the image, and what
color dominates the image and so on.

25
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:13,470
Now, computers are dumb. I mean you
have to tell them what to do exactly.

27
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:19,530
That's where Python comes in. We'll use
Python to load images and process them,

29
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:26,850
and do things like phase and motion
detection. Now vision includes both

31
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:33,119
images and videos because videos are
simply stacks of images that show very

33
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:40,710
fast. So computers and therefore Python
use the same commands to read images and

35
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:48,270
videos and you can do computer vision
with Python using OpenCV. OpenCV stands

37
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:52,829
for open source computer vision and
is a library used not only in

39
00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:57,479
Python, but in other programming
languages as well to do computer vision

41
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:01,979
tasks. So in this section I will
introduce it to OpenCV and you will

43
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:07,799
learn how to use it by detecting faces
from images. And then in the next section

45
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:12,489
we'll dive deeper and
process videos with OpenCV and detect

47
00:02:12,489 --> 00:02:19,450
moving objects in real time webcam video.
So yeah, that's about this lecture and

49
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:25,330
let's move on and quickly set up OpenCV
in the next lecture, and then work with it

51
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:28,019
after that. So yeah, thanks
and see you in the next lecture.
