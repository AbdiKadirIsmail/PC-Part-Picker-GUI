Hi there, and in this lecture what you're
going to do is start to build our

3
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:10,620
Bookstore program, and specifically we're
going to work on the graphical user

5
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:16,680
interface because you know this program
has two parts so to say. So it has a

7
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:22,680
backend and it has frontend.
The backend is the sqlite3

9
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:29,880
database code, so the code that interacts
with the database and the frontend is a code

11
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:36,210
of the Tkinter library, so the code that
builds up all these buttons, these

13
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:43,140
entries, this text, this list box, and
this scroll bar. So normally you'd have

15
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:47,969
to choose whether you want to work on
the backend code first or you want to

17
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:52,860
start building the frontend code but
first of all though the very first thing

19
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:57,570
you want to do is actually to start
defining some requirements. So you want

21
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:02,789
to see what your program will do.
So let's say you want your program to show

23
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:07,799
a list of the current records, so when
you press view all, you see the list of

25
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:12,000
records here, and then you want your
program to search a current entry, and

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,009
then you want to add entry and update
and select data, and then you want your

29
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:21,869
program to close the window. So basically
these are our requirements and now you

31
00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:26,189
can choose to start writing the backend
so you could write a function that

33
00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:31,350
selects all the data from the database
and then you could return those data as text.

35
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:36,090
So you can just print them out just for
now if you want to write the backend

37
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:39,570
first because you don't have the frontend.
You don't have a graphical

39
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:46,500
user interface built yet, so you can just
write the functions of the backend and then

41
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:53,009
print out the output, or you can start
writing the front end first, so you build

43
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:58,020
this graphical user interface, but when
you click those buttons nothing happens.

45
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:02,790
So basically you just draw this thing
with Python, and then once you have done

47
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:08,310
that, you start building the backend and
then you connect all these widgets,

49
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:13,280
all the commands of these buttons,
with your back-end functions.

51
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,870
So it's a matter of preference whether you
choose to work with the back end or the

53
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:22,160
front end first. In this course, in this
section we're going to build the front

55
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,840
end first, so we're going to build
a graphical user interface that will do

57
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:31,580
nothing for a while until we connect it
to the backend. All right then, I would

59
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:36,350
like to first remove this vertical bar
here because I'm going to draw the

61
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:41,090
graphical user interface here, so I'll go,
I'm going to make a sketch for you to see

63
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:47,030
and to have a sketch in here all the time.
So to remove this bar if

65
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:52,580
you're curious you can just go to
settings, then there is a package that

67
00:02:52,580 --> 00:03:01,040
actually shows that bar that's called
Wrap guide and you want to display,

69
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,780
so this displays the line at the eightieth
character in the editor, and that may

71
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:10,430
help you if you want, it may help you to
keep a particular pattern, so you don't

73
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:16,160
want to have more than 80 characters in
your code. So that bar helps you keep that row.

75
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:21,620
Anyway we don't want that
so I just removed it, and I'm just going

77
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:26,660
to write a few notes inside the doc string.
So you know that the doc string

79
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:32,470
is like a comment line, so if you put
any anything inside these triple quotes

81
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:38,720
this is not read as code by Python, but
it's just like a documentation string,

83
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:49,010
so just for humans to read. So let's say
I want a program that stores this book

85
00:03:49,010 --> 00:04:02,630
information, so Title and Author. Year, and
ISBN, so the identification number for

87
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:15,440
books, and the user can view all records.
They can search an entry

89
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:20,829
and add an entry, update an entry.
Delete and they can close the program

91
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:32,910
if they want. Close. Great so if you start
thinking about that and now you'd want

93
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:39,840
to have a graphical user interface that
has all these buttons, so that the user

95
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:45,030
can do these actions through some
buttons, and then you think about how

97
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:50,220
they can view records and you know that
Tkinter has the Listbox widget that

99
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:55,830
allows you to display text as a list, so
line by line, and then you want the user

101
00:04:55,830 --> 00:05:02,130
to search an entry, add an entry, update
entry, so you need some entry widgets.

103
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:07,440
And then of course you'd want some labels
that can tell what each entry is about,

105
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:12,870
so that would be a label widget.
And you may also want a scrollbar,

107
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:19,350
so that your list is scrollable, so if
there are many records the user can

109
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:24,300
scroll through them and they can see
the records under the list, and so

111
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:30,389
we've got a sketch. This of course
requires some fantasy and maybe some

113
00:05:30,389 --> 00:05:35,010
experience with user interface design,
but it's very important that you

115
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:40,650
have a sketch, so I'm going to keep this
sketch on the screen while I code the program.

117
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:46,800
Normally in real life you'd want to have
a drawing maybe on real paper,

119
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,960
or just on a digital screen, but it's
important to have it, and now that we

121
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,360
have it let's start building it
in the next lecture.
