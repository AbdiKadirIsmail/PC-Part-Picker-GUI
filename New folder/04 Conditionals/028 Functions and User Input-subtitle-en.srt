Hi, here is one more lecture about functions
and this one is in a more practical view

3
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:14,340
because what we're going to do is we're
going to, save that, we're going to look at

5
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:20,880
the program that we built in the previous
lecture, sorry in the previous section so

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:27,570
this simple program. Know that these are
the real-life applications that this

9
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:32,160
course covers, so these are just a small
snippet of code, don't confuse this

11
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,930
with the real-life applications. I will
cover 10 real world applications later in

13
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:46,980
course. Until in this program will this
did was it asked you for the age and

15
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:54,289
let me guess M that's not exactly my age
but anyway 90, so this will print out

17
00:00:54,289 --> 00:01:00,930
your age plus 50, so 90 in this
case and what I want to do in this

19
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:08,150
lecture is I want to organize this code
better by putting this inside a function

21
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:14,610
so this will help you understand
functions, how they are used in a more

23
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:20,790
real-life situation. So the function
basically had three components and that

25
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:25,290
was input, the body of the functions,
so the operations that the function

27
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:31,200
performs, and then the output so in this
case we are going to somehow get the

29
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:37,560
input from this, user prompt and then
this will be a body of our function and

31
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:44,369
then we will output this one here.
The new age variable so let's go ahead and

33
00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:55,290
define a function here, define age foo.
Let's keep it like that and we're going to

35
00:01:55,290 --> 00:02:07,500
get some age input there and there
goes this line, so the new age will be

37
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:12,020
equal to the input that the function
will pass in here.

39
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:20,390
So we convert that input to float and
then we add 50 to that and then we return

41
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:27,330
new age, so once you have defined a
blueprint so to say,

43
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:33,210
once you define your function, then you
want to prompt the user for a value, so

45
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:38,120
that you have a value already there to
pass it to the function code later here.

47
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:51,300
Which will be like print age foo age
goes there. Now don't confuse this age

49
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:56,190
variable with this one here, they just
happen to be the same but these are not

51
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:59,180
the same because this is a local
variable,

53
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:05,220
while this one in here is a local, global
variable, sorry. Global variable, local

55
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:14,940
variable so what happens is when Python
executes this script it goes line by

57
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:22,620
line, so it reads the first line, second,
third and it knows, it sort of records

59
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:28,410
in the memory this kind of blueprint
but anyway this is just a blueprint so

61
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:33,090
it will not output anything, and then it goes
to the next line this is empty, okay go

63
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:37,470
to the next line. Age equals to input.
We have an input function which creates a

65
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:43,830
user prompt, so it prompts the user this
message and then the user

67
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:50,459
submits a value and that value is
stored in the age variable.

69
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:56,580
So this is a global variable. It doesn't have to do
with this one here and then what happens

71
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:07,260
is we call the function age foo and inside
that function we pass the value stored in

73
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:15,750
this age global variable, so let's say the
user passed 40. 40 will be passed in

75
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:25,740
here so 40 here which means this 40
will be passed to this age argument

77
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:30,949
so to this variable, so the local
variable now we'll get a value of 40 and

79
00:04:30,949 --> 00:04:37,919
that value will be put in here, so float
40 plus 50 equals 90 and that will

81
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:47,990
return 90, so that 90 will replace this
thing in here and Python will print 90

83
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:56,639
point zero in the command prompt in the
terminal here. Let me try that. Enter age.

85
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:01,800
40. 90 point zero. And yes
basically that's how you integrate user

87
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:09,409
inputs with functions. That's about this
lecture. I'll talk to you later.
