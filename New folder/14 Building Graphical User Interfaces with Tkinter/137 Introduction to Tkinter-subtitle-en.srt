00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:06,630
Hello and welcome to this new section of the course. In this section you're going to learn how to build

2
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:08,990
graphical user interfaces with Python.

3
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:14,410
And specifically are we are going to use the Tkinter library for that.

4
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:20,580
So in this section you're not going to build any real world program. I'll introduce you to the Tkinter library.

5
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:27,350
And of course to build a graphical user interface a small program that can get you started with Tkinter.

6
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:28,980
And then in the next section,

7
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:35,130
so once we are done with this section, in the next section you're going to learn how to interact with

8
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:37,350
databases with Python.

9
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:45,840
So we'll be using Python as a wrapper of SQL code so that we can store data in a database, query data

10
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:49,080
delete and so on and so forth.

11
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,170
So that was the section after this one.

12
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:57,630
And then in the third section after this two sections we are going to build a real world program and

13
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:00,290
that the program is this one here.

14
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:02,330
So I called it bookstore.

15
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:08,880
And what this does is it allows you to store book information in a database.

16
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:11,460
This is a graphical user interface.

17
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:15,110
So this program is made in two parts.

18
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:20,790
You have the graphical user interface which are this buttons here which are called widgets and this was built with Tkinter.

19
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:28,760
And then you have the backhand which consists of code that communicates with

20
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:29,790
the database.

21
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:36,690
So for example if we press the view all bottom we are  quering the database to load all the books for us.

22
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,270
So we have the title.

23
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:48,570
So if you press one of them you get the title here, the author and the year of the book and also the book identification

24
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:53,010
number which is called ISPN. You can also search for an entry.

25
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:59,370
So if you want to search for an author you'd write the author name in here and press search.

26
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:07,140
And if you want to add an entry you would just type that in.

27
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:12,170
And yes something like that.

28
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:13,520
Add entry.

29
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:18,440
And if load them again your entry should be here.

30
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,730
So this is the program we're going to build two sections after this one.

31
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:29,750
So let me close this one here and in the next lecture I'll introduce you to the Tkinter library.

32
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,280
So we'll be building some simple interfaces with some widgets.

33
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:35,390
See you in the next lecture.
