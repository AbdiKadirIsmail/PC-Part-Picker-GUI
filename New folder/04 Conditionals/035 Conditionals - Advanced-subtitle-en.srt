Hi again, you should be able to remember
this program which we built in one of

3
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:10,830
the previous lectures. What this does is
it has this function definition which

5
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:17,520
gets the age and then it adds 50 to the
age and that returns age plus 50 here and

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,260
you ask the user to enter some input
and then you pass that input to the

9
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:26,849
program and then the program produces
you know the age that the user submits

11
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:41,489
plus 50. That's the idea. Let's say 40 and
get 90 point. Now the user may also

13
00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:47,700
want to pass 200 for example for the age
and you get to 250 which is not very

15
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:54,050
realistic let's be honest and here is
where you want to make your program more

17
00:00:54,050 --> 00:01:00,960
intelligent here is where you use a
conditional, so slowly you are seeing how

19
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:08,549
you can use features of a programming
language to make some real programs this

21
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:13,770
is not the real world program because in
this it's depending on the a common

23
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:19,560
line interface is not very friendly to
execute programs this way, but the logic

25
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,330
is going towards a real world program so
let's go ahead and improve the program

27
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:34,290
so that if the user submits an age of
let's say more than 150 you will not

29
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:40,829
calculate 150 plus 50 instead you will
you print out a message that says you

31
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:45,270
it's not possible to have this age or
something like. Let's go ahead

33
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:50,909
and do that. This is a function
definition. Now you shouldn't incorporate

35
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:55,560
the conditional inside the function
definition. You know it's good to leave

37
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:01,579
functions simple as it is now so it gets
an input and it calculates the output,

39
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:09,599
so you can incorporate the conditional
when you call the function in here, so

41
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:16,480
let me delete that. The function of you
and then you asked for input, and then

43
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:22,210
instead of calling the function right
away you first want to check, to evaluate

45
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:31,930
the input that the user submits, so let's
check that. If age is less than 150 that

47
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:39,820
is the time when you want to call the
function age, so you're passing age in

49
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:52,240
there, else, so if it's not less than 150
you want to print out the message saying

51
00:02:52,240 --> 00:03:03,610
something like how is that possible.
So let me pass the print here as well, so

53
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:09,790
we're printing the output. And let me
execute. I expect to get an error

55
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:17,410
here, but it's good to take things step
by step. Enter your age. Let me enter 99

57
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:26,670
first and yeah you get an error which
says type error. Unorderable types string

59
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:31,980
is less than integer, so basically
Python cannot compare a string object

61
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:37,660
with an integer and this is in line 7
which is this one here so this is a string.

63
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:43,500
This is an integer and the reason is that you know as
I have mentioned before Python loads

65
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:49,720
user input as strings, so age will be a
string data type so you want to convert

67
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:54,700
that into an integer or float. It's good
to convert it to a float. You can either

69
00:03:54,700 --> 00:04:03,190
do that here or you can do it here.
I'll do it here like that, but if you do it

71
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:10,750
there then you can remove that from
there, so don't need to convert age

73
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:17,049
twice to a float, you know you can convert
it at the source in here and then you

75
00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:22,090
can use it directly everywhere in your
code so this is good when you're using

77
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:26,010
this input more than once in your code.
You can covert it directly

79
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:38,610
here. Float, save, try again and you get
the output so 99 plus 50, 149, and let

81
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:44,480
me try again
to enter 151 which is above the threshold.

83
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:50,810
You get how is it possible?
That the idea. This is how you use

85
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:56,100
conditional blocks. If your imagination
is good then you can go ahead and improve

87
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:01,920
this program even further, so there's
always something to improve. Give it

89
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:06,260
a try and I'll talk to you later.
Thanks.
