00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,780
Welcome to this new section, and in this
section you're going to learn how to

3
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:09,870
build a real world program that allows the
user to store information about books, so

5
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:13,920
I have already builded a program and I'll
show you step by step how you can do the

7
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,029
same. I have the program here and it's an
executable file.

9
00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:22,859
So apart from learning how to build the
a dot py program ,you'll also to learn how

11
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:28,349
to build executable files and that run on
windows and dot app files that run on Mac.

13
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:33,090
So you can basically, you give your
program to anyone and they don't need to

15
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:42,840
have Python installed in their computer.
So I called the program Bookstore, and this

17
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:48,090
was built mainly with tkinter which is a
graphical user interface library and the

19
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:55,410
SQLite3 library which is a library
to interact with SQLite database. So what

21
00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:01,320
we got here are four entries where you
can enter a new book record, so let's say

23
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,309
you've got a new book in your store and
you want to add it in your database.

25
00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:11,580
And here you can see all the books that have
been added to the program. You can add a

27
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:19,890
new book, let's say pythons for title.
Ardit, quickly and 1918. You have the ISBN

29
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:27,210
number which is a unique identification
number for books. It's quite long.

31
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:32,579
Let's say like that, and you add entry and
then you view all again. And you'll see

33
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:37,829
that the new entry was added to the
database, so every record that you see

35
00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:42,750
here is actually stored in a table inside
this itel1 database. Let me add some

37
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:48,119
other buttons here. So if you want you
can actually search for entry, for record.

39
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:53,159
Search entry and then it will
display the entry that you searched.

41
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:58,079
When you click on the entry you get all the
fields displayed in each of the text box here.

43
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:05,960
So, view all again and you can also
update and delete the records.

45
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:12,209
And finally you can close the window.
So it's not a great user interface.

47
00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:16,890
I'm not a great user interface designer,
but you will learn a lot by

49
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:22,500
building this program, so it's quite a
long one but it will pay off.

51
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,860
So let's kick it off.
