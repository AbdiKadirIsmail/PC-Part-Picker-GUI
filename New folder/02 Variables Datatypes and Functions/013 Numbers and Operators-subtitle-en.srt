Hi again, in this lecture I'll show you
how to do math operations with numbers.

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:10,200
So we're going to look at math operators.
Let's go straight away and open a Python

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:16,880
section and let me write a math
expression there. 20 minus 10 divided by

7
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:31,019
5 times 3 in the power of 2 and what we
get is 2.0. So why did I write this a

9
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:36,239
long expression? Well because I want to
explain to you the order of operators so

11
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:41,760
when you have multiple operators in an
expression the one to be executed

13
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:50,910
first is the exponent, so we have 3 in
power of 2 here that will give us 9.

15
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:56,120
So power is the first to be executed and
also that is division and multiplication.

17
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:00,210
Actually division and
multiplication are on the same level.

19
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:06,330
We're talking about order but the one
that is first will be executed first so in

21
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:11,640
this case division is the first one so
what will happen here is Python will

23
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:16,500
ignore minus for now,
so it will divide 10 by 5 and it will

25
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:30,180
give 2 then it will do 2 times 9.
So again 10 divided by 5, 2 times 9, 19.

27
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:35,220
And then we have the rest of the operators
which could be a plus or minus so in

29
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:45,299
this case we have minus so 20 minus 18.
We have 2.0. You'd ask why we have 2.0?

31
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:54,509
Because 10 divided by 5 gives 2.0.
So division outputs a float in Python 3.

33
00:01:54,509 --> 00:02:00,540
If you are on Python 2, it would output
an integer. Now to make your expressions

35
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:10,590
look better, you'd want to remove the
spaces for the power operator and also

37
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:15,569
you do like that somehow you can read it
better,

39
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:23,550
so 2 times 9 and then 20 minus 18 and so on.
You get the idea.

41
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:33,599
You get 2.0 again and now if you want to
execute the minus operator first

43
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:38,569
you'd want to put that inside brackets.
So why did we get 18? Well because 20

45
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:52,940
minus 10 gives 10 and then 10 divided by
5 gives 2 and then 2 times 9 gives 18.

47
00:02:52,940 --> 00:03:02,459
That's the idea. And then you could also do
this, put these in brackets and what

49
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:13,890
would happen here is you know 10 here,
15 here in the power of 2, so 15 in the

51
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:20,459
power of 2, and then 10, so 10 divided by
15 in the power of 2. Let's see what we get.

53
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:25,920

Yeah we got that, so let's see if I was

55
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:31,260
Right.
15 in the power of 2 we get 225.

57
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:42,510
And then we got 10 on the other side, so 10
divided by 225. We get that number.

59
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:46,349
So whenever you want to change the
order of operators, you should use

61
00:03:46,349 --> 00:03:53,549
brackets and so I hope you get the idea
and please try this out, so try to do a

63
00:03:53,549 --> 00:03:57,569
few operations with numbers to get used to it.
And yeah, I'll talk to you later.

65
00:03:57,569 --> 00:04:00,379
Thanks.
