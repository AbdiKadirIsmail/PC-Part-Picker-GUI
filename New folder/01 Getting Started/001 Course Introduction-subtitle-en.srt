Hi there and welcome
to the Python Mega Course:

3
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:08,040
Build 10 Real World Applications.
I assume you're curious to know what

5
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:11,400
this course contains, and you also want
to know what you will achieve by

7
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,570
completing this course, so that's what
this introductory video is all about.

9
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:21,680
My name is Ardit Sulce and I have been
teaching on Udemy more than one and a half years

11
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,890
now and I have thousands of students
and thousands reviews on my courses as well.

13
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:31,500
I'm also a freelancer mainly using Python
for data analysis and visualization.

15
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:36,210
I have worked in the GIS sector as well
where Python has a very respected

17
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:41,340
position. Back to the course content now.
You don't need any previous knowledge of

19
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:46,320
Python to take this course. The course
will take you from zero and you'll build

21
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,680
up the skills slowly and advance them as
you will build these 10 applications.

23
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:57,270
This is called a Mega Course because
first, it has 22 hours of content and

25
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:02,430
second, the course will guide you on how
to create 10 large applications in

27
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:07,740
different areas of Python starting from
data analysis to visualizations on the

29
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:13,470
web and web apps with data bases and
many more, and specifically you will

31
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:19,200
build these 10 applications. First, you
start small by first building a program

33
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,110
that generates texts given
some user-defined rules.

35
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:27,509
Then, as the second application
you'll build a program that creates

37
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:31,770
Web Maps, and after that you'll build
a program that blocks access to certain

39
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:37,170
websites in certain hours during the day
in your computer. This program has been

41
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:41,579
quite useful for me personally as it
doesn't let me browse destructive

43
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:46,200
websites while I'm working,
so that improves my productivity.

45
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,460
And then as the fourth application you are
going to build a website with Python and

47
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:55,350
the Flask framework and not just that,
but you will also learn how to deploy

49
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:59,790
the website in a live server so that
everyone can see your website through

51
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:06,240
the website URL address. Then you will build
a desktop program that interacts with

53
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:12,330
a database and lets users store, delete,
and view data through the program graphical

55
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:16,920
user interface which you are going to build
with Python. Next you will create a program

57
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:22,980
that starts the computer webcam and
start recording a video, and in detects

59
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:28,379
movement live in the video frame that
is being captured, and so the program

61
00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:34,379
also records motion data and produces a
web graph with an overview of the motion

63
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:39,980
that took place in front of the camera.
And all this process is fully automatic.

65
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:45,060
Next you will create a web scraper which
is a program that extracts data from

67
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:51,419
websites and stores those data in a web
structure format such as CSV or Excel files.

69
00:02:51,419 --> 00:02:57,209
Then you'll create a web app which
visualizes stock market data on a web page.

71
00:02:57,209 --> 00:03:01,939
This is very useful for people who work
on data analysis and visualizations.

73
00:03:01,939 --> 00:03:08,040
After that you'll build a web app using
Python and the flask web framework. This

75
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:12,659
web app will have a PostgreSQL database
as well in the backend, and in the frontend

77
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:18,989
it will have an HTML form where users
can submit data and then the program

79
00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:25,379
sends an automatic email to the users
with some statistics extracted from the

81
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:30,150
back-end database. So that's a very
interesting web application with lots of

83
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:35,669
features, and lastly you will create a
web application that lets users submit

85
00:03:35,669 --> 00:03:41,750
addresses of locations, and the program
converts those addresses to geographic

87
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:48,359
numeric coordinates and lets the user
download the output through the web page.

89
00:03:48,359 --> 00:03:52,919
So that's about the 10 applications.
All the content is yours and you have

91
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:59,459
unlimited access, however here is my
advice now. Let's be honest,

93
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:02,009
if all you do is watching the videos
without trying the code

95
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:07,319
that I show in the videos, you won't be
able to learn Python easily. You cannot

97
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:11,189
learn how to drive a car by just
watching someone else do it, right?

99
00:04:11,189 --> 00:04:14,819
So make sure you write and play around with
the code I show you the videos

101
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:20,579
and don't just copy my code, but try to
experiment, change some parts of the code,

103
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:26,279
Run the program again and see how the
output changes. Also try to solve the

105
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:30,000
assignments you are given because there
are a few assignments throughout the course.

107
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,470
And also ask questions in the Q&A area,
so in the question-and-answer area.

109
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:42,750
Do internet research and be persistent
on solving code issues which always

111
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:48,300
arise while programming no matter how
good you are. If you do all that you'll

113
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:52,349
have very good control of the Python
programming language and you'll be ready

115
00:04:52,349 --> 00:04:57,930
to apply for at least an entry-level job
after you finish this course. That's about

117
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:02,009
the course. Now feel free to go to the
next lecture and I wish you good luck!

119
00:05:02,009 --> 00:05:03,709
Thanks!
