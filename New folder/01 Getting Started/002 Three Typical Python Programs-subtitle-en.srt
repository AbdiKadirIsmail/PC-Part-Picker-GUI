1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,210
Great, before we go ahead and learn about
the Python basic such as variables,

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:11,550
functions and so on I think it's good
that's you understand how a Python

5
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:15,389
program looks like. This is especially
good if you have never programed before.

7
00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:20,490

languages you may have three kinds of

9
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:25,080
programs and I'll tell you why we have
three kinds of programs so you may have

11
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:30,029
a program with a command line interface
such as this one here. You may have a

13
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:36,090
program with a graphical user interface
such as this one here, so it's a desktop

15
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:40,680
application and you may also have for
web applications such as this one in

17
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:46,649
here that runs on the browser and it
can be accessed through the internet.

19
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:50,430
Now the first thing you should know is that
all these programs they are based on a

21
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:59,190
dot py file such as this ones in here
so this is a Python file and whenever

23
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:04,710
you start building something you should
write your code in this script I which

25
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:11,760
looks like this one here, anyway and then
once you have that script you can either

27
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:19,200
run it through the command line interface
such as this one, script 4.py

29
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,780
Execute it and then you communicate with
the interface so your program your

31
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:31,920
Python program is asking you to enter
some letters in there and so enter V V

33
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:39,119
and c for consonants consonants. L or C, anyway
and get some output in the command line

35
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:46,799
Interface. Now when do you use such a program?
Well, you do this program if you not

37
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,509
planning to distribute this program to
normal users, to people who don't know

39
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:56,909
programming so I use Python,
the Python program which I have

41
00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:00,450
already installed and I show and I'll
show you how to install that later so I

43
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:05,219
use Python and that points to the Python
script so to the Python program to execute

45
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:10,080
the program. Now, normal users they don't have
Python installed or they don't know how

47
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,160
to execute a Python program and that's
why you have

49
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:19,920
graphical user interface there such as
this one, or browsers such as this one

51
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:26,730
in here and yeah why don't you use
desktop application such as this? Well you'd

53
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:31,350
use that if you just want to distribute
your program to a specific number of

55
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:36,870
users let's say you work on a
company and you will want to build a

57
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:42,360
program for the employees of a company
to do specific tasks and so you could

59
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:49,560
build this program and it's possible to
create an executable file out of your

61
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:53,880
Python program. This particular one is
A dot exe file for Windows, it runs on

63
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:58,410
Windows as a standalone program but you
can also create dot app files for Mac

65
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:02,940
computers and then the user they don't
need to have for installed. They would

67
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:10,410
simply execute the dot exe file and they
can use the application so yeah, that's

69
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:16,350
the application. We will be building all these
three applications in the course so the

71
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:21,209
command line interface, the web
application and the desktop based

73
00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:26,550
application and then you have
web applications such as this one you here.

75
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:32,850
So when would you use a web application?
Well the web applications are best when

77
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:38,400
your audience is large so basically you
may want as many users to your

79
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,410
application as possible so for
instance what we have here is this is a

81
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:49,739
geocoder service. It geocodes, it converts
addresses to latitude and longitude

83
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:56,700
coordinates so what users can do here is
they can choose a file, so s CSV file and

85
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:01,950
then you calculate latitude and
longitude and send them back as csv file

87
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:10,230
with those values so a web application in
simple words can be for anyone and this

89
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:15,480
also is based on dot py files on the
background so I will show these files

91
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:21,660
for now we're going to build all these
applications as I told you so,

93
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:26,660
yeah that's about this lecture I hope you
have a clear idea now

95
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:31,700
Of what a program, a Python program looks
like and what you can do with Python as well.

97
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:37,460
If you have questions please feel
free to ask them in the Q&A section, so in

99
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:42,170
the discussion area of the course and
yeah I'll be happy to help you. Hope you

101
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:46,330
enjoyed this and I'll to talk you in the next
lectures.
