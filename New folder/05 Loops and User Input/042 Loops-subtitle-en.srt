Hey, in this lecture you'll learn about loops
and loops are very important.

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:10,590
They are one of the fundamental building
blocks of the Python programming language

5
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:15,809
and of every other programming language
as well because loops are crucial.

7
00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:21,630
So what are loops? Well loops are basically
the way that allows you to execute the

9
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:26,789
statement multiple times, so what does
that mean? Let's say you have a bunch of

11
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:32,040
files, text files and you want to insert
a certain string inside each of these

13
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:37,140
text files, so you'd have to open those
text files in Python by writing the

15
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:42,090
Python code that corresponds to opening
a file and then you insert that string

17
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:46,649
inside the file and close the file and
save it, so there is some code that does

19
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:52,199
this opening and inserting the text and
closing the file and if you had 100

21
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:57,570
files you'd have to execute that code
100 times so you'd come up with let's

23
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:03,480
say 100 lines of code but that doesn't
sound very efficient so that's what loops

25
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:08,970
are for. So a productive way to solve the
problem that I just mentioned would be

27
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:13,530
to create a list of these files so
Python lists all of the file names and

29
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:20,310
then you would use a loop to iterate
through this list of file names and a loop

31
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:25,439
would do all that in just a few lines of
code and there are two kinds of loops in

33
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,240
Python, there is a for loop and a problem
for example that I just mentioned would

35
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:36,600
be solved using a for loop and we also
have the while loop. A while loop does

37
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:41,700
also repeatedly execute a statement
that you give, that you write and it

39
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:47,280
executes it as long as the given conditional
true, so let's say you have a user that

41
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,770
is trying to login in your web app and
while he keeps entering their own

43
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:59,130
password, you'd continue executing a
statement that would reject his login to

45
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:04,049
your system, so while the password is
wrong reject the user, something like that.

47
00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:09,149
So that's about the definition of
the for loop and the while loop. In our

49
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:14,370
next lecture I'll show you the syntax of
the for loop and by also looking at an example,

51
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:18,329
so see you in the next lecture.
