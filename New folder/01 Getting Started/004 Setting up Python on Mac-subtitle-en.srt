Hi and welcome to this new lecture, in
this lecture you're going to learn how

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:11,340
to set up Python in a Mac computer so if
you are Windows user you can skip this

5
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:15,089
lecture because you have a Windows
computer and we explained how to set up

7
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:19,859
platform on Windows previously in the
previous lectures and the instructions

9
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:26,730
or will also work for Linux computers
because a Mac is based on Unix and so

11
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:33,480
let's begin, first thing you need to know
is that you already have Python on your

13
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:39,629
Mac so Python comes shipped with Mac by
default now let's go and open Python.

15
00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:47,280
I'm going to click here and then type
terminal and then open a terminal app so

17
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:54,270
terminal is equivalent of a command line
on Windows and here no let's go ahead and

19
00:00:54,270 --> 00:01:01,020
open Python, you can simply call Python
and if you see these three arrows there

21
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:09,570
that means you are able to start a Python
session so good news, however if you

23
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:16,500
look here you'll see this is Python 2.7
so it's a bit outdated and the current

25
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:22,409
version of python is Python 3 so it's
recommended that you actually install

27
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:30,659
Python 3 on your Mac or Linux instead of
using the old version Python 2.7 because

29
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:34,619
we're going to use a lot of libraries
later on the course and some libraries

31
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:43,290
may not be compatible for Python 2.7. You
can still work with to python 2.7 if you

33
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:49,740
take the responsibility to fix errors
and compatibility issues that may arise

35
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:57,360
as you learn Python, so it's going to be
maybe some extra work, however I advise

37
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:03,899
you to install Python 3, so I'm going to
exit Python 2 and the Python 2 session, exit

39
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:12,450
and two brackets and you go again back
to the terminal. To install Python 3 open

41
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:22,650
a browser
and then you should go to python.org, then go to

43
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:29,220
downloads and then install the latest
version of Python which should be shown

45
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:35,790
here so python 3.6 is the current
version and that should download

47
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:44,520
Python, you can see this bar in here and so
please don't uninstall Python 2.7 if you

49
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:50,670
are planning to install Python 3.6
because Python 2.7 is connected to your

51
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:54,810
operating system so if you uninstall it
it you may harm your operating

53
00:02:54,810 --> 00:03:02,310
system, so you may get some messy errors
there so simply ignore python 2.7 and so

55
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:08,280
leave it be, don't uninstall it and
simply click on this package that

57
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:14,850
you had just downloaded you should see
the installation wizard so simply go

59
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:22,620
and click continue, continue, continue
again and read the license if you like.

61
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:33,000
I'm going to go and click on agree and than
install provide your user name in there, your

63
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:42,240
Mac user name, click on install software
and so finally the installation was

65
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:51,600
smooth and it was successful, click on
Close, I'm going to move it to trash.

67
00:03:51,600 --> 00:04:00,180
So the installation package and now go
ahead and go back to terminal, so

69
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:08,940
again if you enter Python you're going
to get Python 2.7, so how do you get

71
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:17,520
Python 3? Well exit and simply click
Python 3 just like that execute and

73
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:24,180
you'll see that this is Python 3.6.
And yeah good luck. And so normally this

75
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:29,730
is the command you will be using on Mac
which means whenever I type Python on

77
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:37,200
Windows you're going to type Python 3 on
Mac or Linux as easy as that, so now you

79
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:47,190
have Python installed and here you can
do operations, you know you get the idea.

81
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:55,860
However please note that what we do here
we programming interactively so we're

83
00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:00,720
simply writing some lines with code but
these lines will not be saved anywhere if

85
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,070
we write them in this interactive
Session, so what we want to do is we want

87
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:11,550
to write scripts of code, so Python files
which we can save, we can save the code

89
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:16,920
and we can execute all the lines at one
and we'll be doing that in the next

91
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:22,920
lecture so please follow me and I hope
it works for you and I'll talk to you in

93
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,370
the next lecture.
