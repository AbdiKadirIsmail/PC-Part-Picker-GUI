Hello there and welcome to this new
section of the course. In the previous

3
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:10,950
section so through all the lectures of
the previous section I covered how to

5
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:15,900
set up Python on your computer and also
the Atom editor and also show you how to

7
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:21,480
create a Python program which is this
one in here that we created, so at this

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,949
point you should have an editor and you
should know how to create a Python file

11
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:32,340
and write some code in it like this one
in here. Now in this new section what

13
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:37,800
I'll cover is variables and data types.
So in the next lecture you'll be able to

15
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:42,780
create and understand variables and in
the lectures after that you're going to

17
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:48,480
learn about the various data types that
we use in Python so in this video I just

19
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,500
wanted to introduce you to this new
section and let's go to the next video

21
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,239
where I'll explain variables see you.
