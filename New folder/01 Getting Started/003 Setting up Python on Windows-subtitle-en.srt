Hello there and welcome to this new
lecture! In this lecture I'll show you

3
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:09,240
how to set up Python in your computer.
Specifically these instructions are for

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:15,210
Windows users so if you are a Mac or
Linux user you can skip this lecture

7
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:18,300
and you can go to the next lecture where
I'll show you how to set up Python on a

9
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:24,420
Mac and instructions also work for Linux
users so Windows users please follow if

11
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:29,490
you haven't installed Python yet, we're
going to download and install python and

13
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:36,630
also try Python out. And so you go to
python.org that's the official Python

15
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:41,760
website and you go to downloads and here
you'll see the latest Python version.

17
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:51,600
Currently it is 3.6.0.
Just click that and save file.

19
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:57,750
Also notice that there's also a version
of Python 2 so Python 2.7 to be exact

21
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:05,369
but Python 2 is not being supported
anymore after 2020 so Python 2 is slowly

23
00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:12,780
retiring so it's advisable to use Python
3 this one in here and once you have

25
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:22,080
downloaded the dot exe file just click it.
Run. You can choose to install it in the

27
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:27,509
default directory but you can also do a
customized installation if you want to

29
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:32,700
change the directory, anyway make sure
you have checked this option at Python

31
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:40,320
3.6 to PATH so I'm going to go with the
default installation process. Yeah that

33
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:45,329
was it. Set up was successful. You can
close the window now and we can go ahead

35
00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:52,079
and open Pythom so how do we do that
on windows? Well we can press the

37
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:58,590
Windows key button, so we're talking
about the Win key. By pressing it you

39
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:03,990
will be able to search on the start
button, alternatively you can simply go

41
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:10,289
to the start button, click it and then
type cmd and then click on c armed.exe

43
00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:15,470
and that will open the windows command prompt.
And so this is like the terminal

45
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:21,110
on Mac or Linux. On Mac and Linux it
is referred to as the terminal on

47
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:26,510
Windows it is referred to as a comand
prompt or command line. To open Python all

49
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:32,930
you have to do is type in Python and
that will open an interactive session of

51
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:39,650
Python and an interactive session is
best for testing out so here you can

53
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:46,970
write lines of code one by one like that
and you promptly get the results in here.

55
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:53,900
So this is why we call it interactive, but
you cannot, it's not very appropriate to

57
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:59,150
write multiple lines of code, so let's
say you have a program that has 10 lines

59
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:05,269
of code and in that case you'd want to
write those lines in a file, in a Python

61
00:03:05,269 --> 00:03:09,290
file but we will cover that later and
this is the interactive shell this is

63
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:14,030
good for testing, so before you do a
program you are not sure about certain

65
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:18,829
aspects, certain commands that you
want to include, certain keywords that

67
00:03:18,829 --> 00:03:23,239
you want including in your program so you
test things out in here very quickly.

69
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:28,220
This is very efficient and it's also
good for learning. To exit the

71
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:36,290
interactive shell you press exit and
brackets, open and closing brackets.

73
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:43,220
Now something you maybe, you probably noted
was that the Python that I opened was version

75
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:51,709
3.5.2 but why is that because I
installed Python 3.6 in here, 3.6, so why did

77
00:03:51,709 --> 00:03:55,010
I get five Python 3.5.2?
Well the answer is that I already had

79
00:03:55,010 --> 00:04:01,310
Python 3.5.2
installed on my Windows so in other words

81
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:09,919
before I install Python 3.6 I could
trigger a Python shell like that so the

83
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:15,260
question is how do I run Python 3.6 now?
Well the first thing you should know is

85
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:20,690
that there is no problem having multiple
Python installations in your system, the

87
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:25,880
key here is that you have to assign
different commands to each of your

89
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:28,430
Python
instalations so for instance Python 3.5.2

91
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:32,540
has these commands
to run Python. Now for Python 3.6

93
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:39,770
we need to assign another
command and I'll go and search for the

95
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:48,800
installation directory of
Python 3.6 so open that and now Windows

97
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:54,470
when you search for Python, when you
enter the Python command here, Windows is

99
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:59,450
looking at the path variable, the Windows
path variable and it's searching for

101
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:05,510
this type of command Python but this
was already occupied by another so by

103
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:09,530
Python 3.5.2, that's why it
triggers Python 3.5.2,

105
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:15,980
so in that case you may want to do
trick here, let's say do Python 36 and

107
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:28,070
restart that command prompt and then
run again python 36 and you get Python 36.

109
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:37,340
So that's the trick and again of course
you can do operations here and so on

111
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:43,760
Of course you still have Python 3.5 at
least I have Python 3.5 maybe you don't

113
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:49,430
because you didn't have any Python
installed just yet, so that's the idea.

115
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:53,720
On your system if you install Python for
the first time, if you install

117
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:58,220
Python 3.6 you'll be
able to execute Python with this commands.

119
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:03,980
Python. If you had an existing Python
installation and you install a new one,

121
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:12,230
no problem, you can run Python 36 like I did
I hope this was clear and I hope you are

123
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:18,460
up and running now with Python
And I'll talk to you in the next lectures.
