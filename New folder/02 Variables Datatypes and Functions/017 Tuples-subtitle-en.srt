00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:05,279
Let's now look at tuples. In the
previous lecture we looked at lists and

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:10,790
tuples are very similar to lists, the
only difference is that tuples are not

5
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:17,520
mutable, so you cannot change a tuple.
Lists are used much more than tuples

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:24,269
so tuples are only using very specific
scenarios, so we will see some scenarios

9
00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:28,109
throughout the course when we build the
real-world applications, so you don't

11
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:32,430
have to worry about understanding when
to use a tuple in programming for now.

13
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:41,640
Anyway I want to show you the syntax, so
you can create a tuple like that.

15
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:48,800
So tuples just like lists, they contain
they may contain different data types.

17
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:56,340
Let's say 3 4 and so on.
Oh sorry, I was writing in the

19
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:04,700
terminal, let me open the Python shell so
again

21
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:11,850
we have strings numbers and floats if you like.
Whatever type that you want you can pass

23
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:17,150
in a tuple and in a list and of course
you can use indexing for tuples as well,

25
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:25,799
so let's access the lost item and that
will give 4.6. The difference is that you

27
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:32,520
know tuples they have some slight
different methods than lists, so if you

29
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:39,600
dir list, you see that lists have
much more methods available than tuples,

31
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:46,890
so for instance you can append items to
a list, you can clear the list and copy

33
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:54,149
and count, count is available for tuples
because count doesn't change the data type,

35
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:58,829
so it doesn't change the tuple, it just
counts how many items are there in the tuple.

37
00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:04,259
As I said, tuples are immutable, so you
cannot change them that's why these

39
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:09,959
methods that change the data type like
inserting new values and popping out

41
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:14,280
values, removing
values, reversing and sorting so these

43
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:19,590
are not available and yeah this is more or
less about tuples. In case you need them

45
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:26,840
later they are there for you. Hope you're
enjoying the course and I'll talk to you later.
